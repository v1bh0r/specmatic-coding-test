# Specmatic Coding Test
[![CI Pipeline](https://github.com/v1bh0r/specmatic-coding-test/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/v1bh0r/specmatic-coding-test/actions/workflows/maven.yml)
### Prerequisites:
JDK 17+ OR Specmatic IDE Plugin

### Instructions:

### 1. Fork this repository on Github. Checkout your forked repo to your local machine.  

**DO NOT RAISE A PR AND SHARE YOUR SOLUTION WITH THE WORLD**

#### Java/Kotlin Steps

From a terminal, run the following command:
```shell
mvn clean test
```
You should see 84 failing tests:
```
[ERROR] Tests run: 84, Failures: 84, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[INFO] 
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD FAILURE
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### IDE Plugin Steps (Programming Language Agnostic)
1. Install [Specmatic VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Specmatic.specmatic-vscode-extension) or [Jetbrains IDEs Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24548-specmatic)
2. Launch command pallet and type "Run Contract Tests", this should launch the Specmatic plugin
3. In the Contract Test Settings screen, update the following:
  * Update API specification file to ./products_api.yaml
  * Select the checkbox for Generative tests
  * Click on the "Save and Run" button
4. You should see 84 failing tests:

```
[ERROR] Tests run: 84, Failures: 84, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[INFO] 
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD FAILURE
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Objective of this Assignment
Your objective is to get all the tests to pass by following the rest of the instructions.

### 2. Introduction to Specmatic
- Watch the [Contract-Driven Development - Turn your API Specification into Executable Contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OvTanLjm20&list=PL9Z-JgiTsOYT66JOxf9c63AzhsK3Jay8P) video on Specmatic. 
- This will really help you to understand how Specmatic works and is necessary background/context about the project. 

### 3. Part 1 - Implement REST endpoints:

#### Java/Kotlin Steps
- This is a Kotlin based Spring Boot application.  
- You are expected to implement the missing endpoints in the **Products** controller.

#### Note:
- You are **not** expected to use a database. Instead, use an in memory map to store and retrieve products.
- Feel free to leverage GPT or Github Copilot.
- Please do not alter the following files:
  - ContractTest.kt
  - products_api.yaml
  - specmatic.json

#### Other Programming Languages Steps
- Pick any programming language and Web API framework of your choice.
- You are expected to implement the missing endpoints.

### 4. Part 1 - Definition of Done
- All 84 tests are passing
- 100% API Coverage from 1 path is achieved
- Code changes are committed to your Github repo.

### 5. Part 2 - Added property 'cost' to the ProductDetails schema
- Update the products_api.yaml OpenAPI specification such that 'cost' is added as a new property to ProductDetails
- This will increase the test count to 197 and cause a few tests to fail
- Update your kotlin code to make all the tests pass again.

### 6. Part 2 - Ensure Backward Compatibility is not broken
```shell
mvn exec:java
```
You should see:
```
The newer contract is backward compatible
```

### 7. Part 2 - Definition of Done
- All 197 tests are passing
- 100% API Coverage is still maintained
- Code changes are committed to your Github repo.

### 8. Trigger the CI pipeline under Github Actions. 
- Make sure all tests are passing on the pipeline as well.
- Email the following details to coding.test@specmatic.in:
  - Screenshot of passing CI pipeline
  - Screenshot of API Coverage report
  - Link to you github repo

### 9. Judging Criteria
- All 197 tests are passing in the Github Actions (CI pipeline)
- 100% API Coverage
- **3 Design Values** are met:
  - Communication
  - Simplicity
  - Flexibility
- **Kent Beck's 4 Rules of Simple Design** are followed:
  - Passes the tests (197 Contract Tests + Bonus points if you write unit tests)
  - Reveals intention (Self-documenting and expressive code)
  - No duplication (Avoid any form of duplication - Literal, Semantic, Structural or Data)
  - Fewest elements (Minimalistic Code - No combinatorial explosion)
- **XP Principles**
  - YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It
  - KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid
  - Triangulate

- Make sure you adhere to your Programming Pradigm specific Design Principles:
  - **Object Oriented**
    - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 
    - Open Closed Principle (OCP)
    - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    - Once and Only Once
    - TDA - Tell Don't Ask
    - The Law of Demeter
  - **Functional Programming**
    - First-Class and Higher-Order Functions
